# Rock, Paper, Scissors Project

Welcome to the Rock, Paper, Scissors project from Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code" course! In this project, you'll play the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer and see if you can outsmart your opponent.

## About the Project

The Rock, Paper, Scissors project is a Python script that allows you to play the game against the computer. The rules are simple: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beat Paper, and Paper beats Rock. You'll make your choice, and the computer will randomly choose its move. The winner will be determined based on the game's rules.
