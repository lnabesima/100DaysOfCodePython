# Treasure Island Project

Welcome to the Treasure Island project from Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code" course! In this project, you'll embark on an exciting text-based adventure on an uncharted island, where you'll make choices that determine the outcome of your journey.

## About the Project

The Treasure Island project is a Python script that simulates a choose-your-own-adventure game. As the player, you'll be presented with various scenarios and choices at different points of the game. Your decisions will shape the story and lead you to different outcomes, making each playthrough unique.
