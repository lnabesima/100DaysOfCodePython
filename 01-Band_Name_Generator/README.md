# Band Name Generator Project

This is the Band Name Generator project from Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code" course! In this project, you'll create band name generator that will come up with band names based on user input.

## About the Project

The Band Name Generator project is a Python script that prompts the user for some information and then combines the user's input to generate a band name. The generated band name will be a fusion of random words, adjectives, and user-provided input, resulting in a band name.

## How to Use the Band Name Generator

1. **Clone the Repository:** To get started, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/lnabesima/100DaysOfCodePython.git
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Navigate to the project directory and run the Python script:

   ```
   cd 01-Band_Name_Generator
   python bandnameGenerator.py
   ```

3. **Follow the Prompts:** The script will guide you through the band name generation process. It will ask you questions or request input to incorporate into the band name.

4. **View the Result:** Once you've provided the necessary information, the band name generator will create a unique band name for you. Enjoy the band name it generates!

## Sample Output

Here's an example of how the Band Name Generator might work:

```
Welcome to the Band Name Generator!

What city did you grow up in? >London

What is the name of your pet? >Sparky

Your band name could be: London Sparky!
```

Remember, each time you run the script and provide different input, you'll get a new band name!
