# Password Generator Project

Welcome to the Password Generator project from Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code" course! In this project, you'll create a
powerful password generator that generates strong and secure passwords to enhance your online security.

## About the Project

The Password Generator is a Python script that allows you to create custom passwords with various characteristics, such
as length, inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. By generating strong and
unique passwords, you can protect your online accounts from potential security breaches.

## How to Use the Password Generator

1. **Clone the Repository:** Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Clone this repository to your local
   machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/lnabesima/100DaysOfCodePython.git
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Navigate to the project directory and run the Python script:

   ```
   cd 05-Password_Generator
   python password_generator.py
   ```

3. **Follow the Prompts:** The script will prompt you to choose the characteristics of your password. You can specify
   the password length, how many letters, numbers and special symbols.

4. **Generate the Password:** Once you've selected your preferences, the password generator will create a random
   password that matches your chosen criteria.

5. **Copy and Use the Password:** You can now use the generated password to enhance the security of your online
   accounts. Be sure to save it in a secure location.

## Sample Output

Here's an example of how the Password Generator might work:

```
