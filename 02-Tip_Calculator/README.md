# Tip Calculator Project

Welcome to the Tip Calculator project from Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code" course! In this project, you'll build a simple tip calculator that helps you calculate the tip amount and split the bill among friends or colleagues.

## About the Project

The Tip Calculator is a Python script that takes user input for the total bill amount, desired tip percentage, and the number of people sharing the bill. It then calculates the tip amount and the total amount each person needs to pay.

## How to Use the Tip Calculator

1. **Clone the Repository:** Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/lnabesima/100DaysOfCodePython.git
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Navigate to the project directory and run the Python script:

   ```
   cd 02-Tip_Calculator
   python tipCalculator.py
   ```

3. **Follow the Prompts:** The script will prompt you to enter the total bill amount, the desired tip percentage, and the number of people sharing the bill. Input the requested information as directed.

4. **View the Results:** The tip calculator will calculate the tip amount, the total bill (including tip), and the amount each person needs to pay. You'll see the breakdown on the screen.

## Sample Output

Here's an example of how the Tip Calculator might work:

```
Welcome to the Tip Calculator

What was the total bill? $75.00
How many people to split the bill? 3
What percentage tip would you like to give? 15

Each person should pay: $28.75
